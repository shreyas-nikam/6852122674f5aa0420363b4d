# AI Risk Score: A Codelab for Navigating the Future of Work

This codelab guides you through the "AI Risk Score" application, a tool designed to help you understand and mitigate potential job displacement risks arising from advancements in Artificial Intelligence. This application focuses on giving you a tangible understanding of how AI can impact your career and provides insights into improving your "AI-Q Score." By working through this codelab, you'll learn how to assess your individual risk factors, understand the broader systematic risks associated with your occupation, and identify valuable learning resources to enhance your skills and secure your future. This isn't about fearing AI; it's about understanding it and adapting to thrive in an evolving landscape.

## Exploring the Risk Assessment Page
Duration: 00:05

This section focuses on understanding your current risk level. We'll be using the "Risk Assessment" page of the application.

1.  **Navigation:**  Using the sidebar on the left, select "Risk Assessment" from the "Navigation" dropdown menu. This will bring you to the risk assessment interface.
2.  **Occupation Input:**  You'll see a field labeled "Occupation". Enter your current job title. This is crucial as the application will use this information (in a more complex, real-world version) to gauge the general automation risk associated with your field.
3.  **Skills Input:** The "Skills" section presents a multi-select box. Choose the skills that are relevant to your occupation from the provided list. These are factors that influence your individual (idiosyncratic) risk.
4.  **Assess Risk:** Click the "Assess Risk" button. The application will then display a preliminary risk assessment based on your inputs.
5.  **Understanding the Output:** The results section presents you with:
    *   Your entered Occupation and Skills.
    *   Idiosyncratic Risk:  This represents your personal risk of displacement, influenced by your skills and other factors.
    *   Systematic Risk: This reflects the broader risk associated with your occupation, regardless of your specific skillset.
    *   Overall Risk Level:  A categorized risk level (Low, Moderate, or High) calculated from the combination of idiosyncratic and systematic risks.

Remember that the specific risk calculations in this demo are simplified. A real-world implementation would use more complex algorithms and data.

## Understanding the AI-Q Score
Duration: 00:05

This section is all about understanding and tracking your "AI-Q Score" as you upskill.

1.  **Navigation:** In the sidebar, select "AI-Q Score" from the "Navigation" dropdown.
2.  **Completed Courses:**  The application presents a multi-select box listing example courses. Select the courses you have completed (or plan to complete). This simulates how acquiring new skills can boost your AI-Q Score.
3.  **AI-Q Score Display:** The application displays your current AI-Q score. Notice how it changes as you select different courses. The score is also represented visually on a gauge chart.
4.  **Gauge Chart Interpretation:** The gauge chart provides a visual representation of your AI-Q score, with color-coded ranges indicating different proficiency levels. Aim to increase your score and move towards the green zone!

## Exploring Learning Resources
Duration: 00:03

This section helps you identify resources to improve your skills and AI-Q score.

1.  **Navigation:** Select "Learning Resources" from the "Navigation" dropdown in the sidebar.
2.  **Recommended Courses:** This section lists recommended courses and provides links to external resources. These courses are examples of skills you can develop to mitigate your AI-related risks.
3.  **Other Resources:** The application also provides links to QuantUniversity Courses and suggests exploring online learning platforms.
