In this lab, we explore the AI Risk Score, a tool to help you understand and mitigate your risk of job displacement due to advancements in Artificial Intelligence.
This application uses the concepts and formulas described in the research document to assess your individual risk (Idiosyncratic Risk) and the broader risk associated with your occupation (Systematic Risk).  By understanding these risks, you can identify skills to develop and improve your overall AI-Q Score, ultimately increasing your job security.
